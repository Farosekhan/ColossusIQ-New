# CollossusIQ — database data dictionary

PostgreSQL 15+ schema for the whole platform: one university (TNTU) with many affiliated colleges across five
streams. The API runs on it with `DATA_BACKEND=postgres`; without that setting it keeps using the in-memory demo
store (see [running the app on PostgreSQL](#running-the-app-on-postgresql)).

## Running it

1. Create an empty database and put its URL in `.env` as `DATABASE_URL` (Prisma reads `.env`, not `.env.local`;
   see `.env.example`).
2. Run the migration, seed and tests:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

```bash
npm run db:test
```

`db:migrate` runs `prisma migrate deploy`. On a database that already had `0001_init.sql` applied by hand, mark the
baseline instead with `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260929000000_init`. With plain `psql`, run the three SQL
files in the same order with `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`; `db/tests/constraints.sql` also prints an `ok …` line per check.

The migration creates the `ciq_app` role (NOLOGIN). Create a login role for the API and `GRANT ciq_app TO` it. Never
run the API as the table owner or a superuser: owners and superusers bypass row-level security.

## Running the app on PostgreSQL

The API's business rules (validation, access checks, grading, generators) live in `src/lib/api/mock/*` and read and
write through the store interface in `src/lib/data/store.ts`. `DATA_BACKEND` picks the implementation:

| `DATA_BACKEND` | Store | Sign-in | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory` (default) | `src/lib/data/memory` | any email and 8+ character password; MFA code 246810 | demo data, reset on restart |
| `postgres` | `src/lib/data/postgres` (Prisma) | the account's argon2id password, for a role it holds in that college; 5 failures lock it for 15 minutes; TOTP | this database |

Local set-up:

1. Prepare a database as in [running it](#running-it), then give the seeded accounts a password (set `DEV_PASSWORD` in
   `.env` first). This also re-signs the seeded certificates with your `SESSION_SECRET`:

```bash
npm run db:dev-accounts
```

2. In `.env.local` set `DATA_BACKEND=postgres`, `DATABASE_URL` and `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32+ characters), then run
   `npm run dev`. Sign in as, for example, the HOD of COL-1001: role *HOD*, college *Anna Institute of Technology*,
   email `hod@ait.edu.in`. The script lists every seeded sign-in.
3. MFA: accounts with an authenticator must use it. Enrol one with `npm run db:dev-accounts -- --totp <email>` and add
   the printed `otpauth://` link to an authenticator app. Accounts without one accept the demo code 246810 **outside
   production only**; in production they are refused until enrolled.

How a request runs:

- Each API request is one transaction that starts with `SET LOCAL ROLE ciq_app` and `app_set_context(college, scope,
  user)`, so row-level security applies even when `DATABASE_URL` is the table owner
  (`src/lib/data/postgres/db.ts`). Server pages use the same context (`withRequestContext`).
- Sessions stay signed cookies. The session `sub` is `users.id`; a suspended account or college loses access on its
  next request.
- Database rule violations become 409/422 responses, never internals.
- What stays in memory in both modes: rate-limit buckets, and generated content (AI replies, module dashboards, role
  homes, mock tests, projects).

Differences from the demo, by design:

- The placement board lists real students, from `v_placement_readiness`, instead of a generated cohort.
- Quiz answers, mock interviews and resume analyses are stored.
- A re-issued certificate supersedes the old one instead of deleting it.
- Withdrawn class summaries are hidden from students, not deleted.

Integration tests: point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at a **throwaway** database prepared as above (with `DEV_PASSWORD`
set), then:

```bash
npx vitest run tests/postgres.integration.test.ts
```

## Conventions

- **Keys.** Every entity has a `uuid` primary key (`gen_random_uuid()`) and, where the UI shows an ID, a `public_id`
  in today's format:

  | Prefix | Example | Generated by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `COL-` | `COL-1001` | sequence from 1001 |
  | `USR-`, `EMP-`, `CRS-`, `EVT-`, `ROT-`, `GAL-` | `EMP-1004` | sequence from 1001 |
  | `ADM-YY-` | `ADM-26-1001` | year + sequence |
  | `LC-`, `QZ-`, `LO-`, `CS-` | `LC-8F3A2C1D` | random hex (`hex_id()`) |
  | `MED-` | `MED-` + 24 hex | random, unguessable |
  | `CIQ-YYYY-` | `CIQ-2026-0941EF15` | year + random hex |

  Lookups use natural or serial keys: `streams.key`, `college_types.name`, and `serial` ids for departments,
  programmes, terms and designations.
- **Timestamps and versions.** Tables edited through forms have `created_at`, `updated_at` (`touch_row()` trigger) and
  `version` (`bump_version()` trigger, +1 on every update). The API uses `version` for optimistic locking:
  `UPDATE … WHERE id = $1 AND version = $2`.
- **Enums.** Values that never vary by college are PostgreSQL enums whose labels are exactly the UI labels
  (`'Documents verified'`, `'Theory + Lab'`). Stream-dependent lists (departments, programmes, terms, designations)
  are lookup tables.
- **Text.** Emails are `citext`, so uniqueness ignores case. Free text has length CHECKs copied from the Zod schemas.
- **JSONB.** It is used only for document-shaped content that is always read and written whole: lesson key points,
  terms and practice, outline blocks, class-summary points, the infographic snapshot, AI results and scorecards. Each
  JSONB column has a `jsonb_typeof` / length CHECK. Anything queried or joined stays relational: lesson videos and
  images, quiz questions and answers, progress, reads.
- **Images.** Image columns come in pairs: `*_media_id` (uploaded, FK to `media_assets`) or `*_builtin` (a bundled
  `/campus/*.svg`). A CHECK allows at most one.
- **Deletes.** College-owned content cascades from its parent (units → lessons → videos). Records that other rows
  depend on for history (students, quizzes with attempts, certificates) use `RESTRICT`/`NO ACTION`. Retire them by
  status instead.

## Access control (row-level security)

The API connects as a member of `ciq_app` and opens every request's transaction with:

```sql
SELECT app_set_context(:college_id, 'college', :user_id);   -- signed-in college user
SELECT app_set_context(NULL,        'all',     :user_id);   -- University Super Admin
```

The settings are transaction-local (`set_config(…, true)`), so pooled connections cannot leak context between
requests. Without a context, college-scoped tables return **no rows**.

| Policy | Tables | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `college_isolation` (FORCE RLS) | admissions, certificates, class_summaries, clinical_rotations, college_modules, college_websites, courses, evaluation_items, events, gallery_items, interview_sessions, learning_courses, lesson_outlines, quiz_attempts, quizzes, resume_analyses, staff, students | read and write only rows where `college_id = app_college()`, unless scope is `all` |
| `media_read` / `media_write` / `media_delete` | media_assets | university-level media (`college_id IS NULL`) is readable by everyone; writes are college-scoped |
| `via_parent` | admission_documents, admission_status_history, class_summary_reads, course_outcomes, course_units, evaluation_overrides, event_registrations, lesson_images, lesson_progress, lesson_videos, lessons, quiz_attempt_answers, quiz_questions | visible only when the parent row is visible |
| — (no RLS) | universities, streams, college_types, departments, programmes, terms, designations | shared lookups; `ciq_app` has SELECT only |
| — (no RLS) | colleges, users, role_assignments, user_credentials, user_mfa, user_sessions | identity and tenancy. Sign-in must read these before a college is known, so the **API** limits them |
| — (no RLS) | notifications, booster_step_completions, faculty_activity_events, audit_log | per-user or append-only logs. The **API** filters by `user_id` / `college_id` |

`ciq_app` cannot UPDATE or DELETE `audit_log`, `faculty_activity_events` or `evaluation_overrides`. A trigger also
blocks it for the owner.

Roles map to `role_assignments`. `admin` and `recruiter` have `college_id NULL`; every other role must have a
college (CHECK). HOD and faculty rows can carry a `department_id`.

## Rules enforced in the database

| Rule | Where | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| Department, programme, term and designation must belong to the college's stream (common designations allowed everywhere) | `enforce_stream_match()` on admissions, students, staff, courses, clinical_rotations, learning_courses, quizzes, class_summaries, role_assignments | `streamRuleErrors` in `src/config/resources.ts` |
| Entrance score ≤ the stream's `entrance_max` (200 / 720 / 100) | same trigger | stream-aware admissions form |
| Clinical rotations only in medical-stream colleges | same trigger | medical-only module |
| Phone `^[6-9][0-9]{9}$`, course code `^[A-Z]{2,4}[0-9]{3,4}$`, college code 4 digits | CHECK | Zod field rules |
| `end_date >= start_date`, attendance 0–100, pass mark 30–90, duration, credits and capacity ranges | CHECK | Zod field rules |
| Exactly 4 options per question, `answer` 0–3 | CHECK on `quiz_questions` | quiz builder |
| At most 3 attempts per student per quiz, safe under concurrency (the trigger numbers attempts 1–3 and `UNIQUE (quiz_id, student_id, attempt_no)` stops two sessions taking the same slot); quiz and student in the same college | `limit_quiz_attempts()`, `same_college_student()` | `learning.ts` |
| One certificate per attempt; one **active** certificate per quiz and student (older ones are superseded, not deleted) | UNIQUE + partial unique index `certificates_one_active` | certificate re-issue |
| Certificate signature is a 43-character base64url HMAC-SHA256 | CHECK | `signCertificate` |
| Event registration only for Published, open events of the student's college, within capacity | `check_event_registration()` | events module |
| Every admission status change is logged with who made it (`app.user_id`) | `log_admission_status()` → `admission_status_history` | new: status history |
| `audit_log`, `faculty_activity_events`, `evaluation_overrides` are append-only | `forbid_mutation()` + revoked grants | audit trail |
| Unit, lesson and question positions unique per parent, checked at COMMIT (`DEFERRABLE`) so reordering can swap positions | deferrable UNIQUE | course editor drag-reorder |

## Placement readiness view

`v_placement_readiness` has one row per active student and replaces the hard-coded 64/48/82 values in the mock. It
is `security_invoker`, so RLS on the underlying tables applies.

| Column | Source |
|---|---|
| `quiz_average` | Mean of the student's best submitted % per quiz, excluding `placement_aptitude` quizzes |
| `certificates` | Active (not superseded) certificates |
| `aptitude` | Best % on any `placement_aptitude` quiz |
| `interview` | `overall_score` of the latest completed mock interview |
| `resume` | `ats_score` of the latest resume analysis |
| `total` | `quiz_average × 0.35 + min(certificates, 4) / 4 × 20 + aptitude × 0.15 + interview × 0.15 + resume × 0.15` |
| `status` | `Placement ready` when total ≥ 70, quiz_average ≥ 60, certificates ≥ 2 and interview ≥ 50; `Almost ready` when total ≥ 55; otherwise `Needs work` |

## Mock store → table map

Each demo store now lives in `src/lib/data/memory/index.ts`; its PostgreSQL counterpart is in `src/lib/data/postgres/`.

| Demo store (originally in `src/lib/api/mock/`) | Tables |
|---|---|
| `records.ts` `stores.colleges` | `colleges`, `college_modules` |
| `records.ts` `stores.users` | `users`, `role_assignments`, `user_credentials`, `user_mfa` |
| `records.ts` `stores.admissions` | `admissions`, `admission_documents`, `admission_status_history`, then `students` once Enrolled |
| `records.ts` `stores.staff` | `staff` |
| `records.ts` `stores.courses` | `courses` |
| `records.ts` `stores.events` | `events`, `event_registrations` |
| `records.ts` `stores.rotations` | `clinical_rotations` |
| `records.ts` `stores.gallery` | `gallery_items` |
| `records.ts` `counters` | per-table `public_id` sequences |
| `website.ts` `sites` | `college_websites` |
| `media.ts` `media` | `media_assets` (`storage_key` for object storage, or `data` bytea for small installs) |
| `course-state.ts` `learningCourses` | `learning_courses`, `course_outcomes`, `course_units`, `lessons`, `lesson_videos`, `lesson_images` |
| `course-state.ts` `lessonProgress` | `lesson_progress` |
| `learning.ts` `quizzes` / `attempts` / `certificates` | `quizzes`, `quiz_questions`, `quiz_attempts`, `quiz_attempt_answers`, `certificates` |
| `teaching.ts` `outlines` / `summaries` / `boosterSteps` | `lesson_outlines`, `class_summaries` + `class_summary_reads`, `booster_step_completions` |
| `faculty-activity.ts` `facultyEvents` | `faculty_activity_events` |
| `router.ts` `interviews` | `interview_sessions` |
| `router.ts` `evalQueues` | `evaluation_items`, `evaluation_overrides` |
| `audit.ts` `auditTrail` | `audit_log` |
| `rate-limit.ts` `buckets` | **not stored in PostgreSQL** (use Redis or the API gateway) |
| session cookie | stays a stateless signed cookie; `user_sessions` exists only for "sign out everywhere" and revocation |
| `src/config/streams.ts`, `tenancy.ts` | `streams`, `college_types`, `departments`, `programmes`, `terms`, `designations`, `universities` (seeded) |

## Gaps closed

What the mock could not represent, and where it now lives:

- **Students as entities.** A student used to exist only as a session subject. Now `students` links the user,
  college, admission, roll number, department, programme and term, and every learning record has a real
  `student_id` FK.
- **Names instead of references.** Course faculty, rotation student and supervisor, and quiz and course authors now
  have FKs (`faculty_staff_id`, `student_id`, `supervisor_staff_id`, `created_by`). The display-name column is kept
  for records created before accounts exist.
- **Per-question quiz answers.** `quiz_attempt_answers` stores them, which enables item analysis.
- **Interview and resume scores.** `interview_sessions` and `resume_analyses` store them and feed the readiness view.
- **Evaluation override reasons.** They were discarded; now `evaluation_overrides` records them, append-only.
- **Admission audit.** Status history is recorded automatically.
- **Certificate history.** Re-issue supersedes the old certificate instead of deleting it.
- **Event sign-ups.** New `event_registrations` table.
